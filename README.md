# Kitten Cloud (Cloudinary Image Upload Demo)

This project demonstrates how to upload images to Cloudinary using Next.js API routes.

![Data Flow](./flow.excalidraw.png)

## `pages/index.js`

`pages/index.js` contains a form that allows you to upload an image to the `api/upload` route using fetch.
It then displays all uploaded images from a state persisted in local storage.

## `pages/api/upload.js`

`pages/api/upload.js` contains the route that handles the image upload.

- It uses the `formidable` package to parse the incoming request.
- It uses the `cloudinary` package to upload the image to Cloudinary.
